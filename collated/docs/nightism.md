    # Product survey on Todoist
    
    ## Introduction
    
    Todoist is a powerful, cross-platform productivity tool. It's available on the
    web, for iOS and Android with desktop apps for Windows and OSX, add-ons for
    Firefox and Chrome, plug-ins for email apps like Postbox, Gmail, Thunderbird,
    and Outlook, and more.
    
    It also packs sub-tasks and dependencies, real-time syncing, projects and
    sub-projects so you can manage daily checklists or big plans that involve lots
    of people, understandable due dates, multiple priorities, categories and
    projects you can set, and more. A premium account is required if you want
    notifications or reminders via email or push notifications on your mobile
    device. You also get labels and filters to further organize your to-dos.
    
    ## Keyboard-oriented (for PC and Web client only)
    
    Todoist is not a fully keyboard-oriented application. Actions will not be done
    by passing in commands lines and most of interactions and manipulations can be
    done using mouse through the pre-designed user interface. However, in Todoist
    there are Keyboard shortcuts provided to users.
    
    #### Positive:
    
    Shortcuts in Todoist help users save time by allowing them to never take their
    hands off the keyboard to use the mouse.
    
    #### Negative:
    
    Todoist does not support command line inputs.
    
    ### Shortcuts that can be used anywhere:
    
    Shortcut | Action

    client-side application on either PC or mobile phone. When the local
    client-side application is connected to the Internet, syncing with the web
    client will also be available.
    
    ## Cannot be summoned quickly
    
    #### Negative:
    
    Todoist cannot be summoned by shortcuts on the keyboard.
    
    ## CRUD for Tasks
    
    #### Positive:
    
    Todoist has full support for the create-read-update-delete(CRUD) of floating
    tasks and deadline-like tasks.
    
    #### Negative:
    
    Todoist does not support CRUD for event-like tasks.

    Todoist is a half keyboard oriented cross-platform applications, with plenty of
    useful keyboard short-cut on both PC and Web clients. It can work both online
    or offline on mobile phone or personal computer.
    
    It fully supports creation, reading, updating and deleting (CRUD) function of
    floating tasks and deadline-like task. The user interface is well designed and
    user can perform their actions quite easily through it. Besides, user can also
    conduct simple searching action among all task he or she has created. However,
    Todoist also does not support the functionality to add event-like task at all.
    
    Also for premium account, Todoist also gives the support of tracking the task
    that has already been done or finished, which gives convenience for user to
    record their working history.
    
    Besides, Todoist can automatically suggest how many tasks have already existed
    on a certain day when creating the tasks. But since Todoist does not support
    event-like task, it also has no support at all for generating suggestion of
    suitable time-slots or placing multiple time slots/blocks when creating the
    tasks.
    
    Moreover, Todoist does support undo-actions, but only for the last one actions
    the user performs.
    
    Furthermore, there are several features that we could learn from Todoist. The
    first one is the “Quick-Add” function which enables the user to add either
    floating task or deadline task in a single window. The second one is the “Undo”
    command, which enables the user to undo the last command immediately when them
    perform wrongly.
