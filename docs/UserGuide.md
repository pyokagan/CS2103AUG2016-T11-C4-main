## About

Unable to keep track of all your deadlines and other commitments?  Finding it
difficult to remember tasks which do not have a specific date and time, but
nevertheless needs to be done?

Fret not, TaskTracker is here to your rescue!

To be simply defined, TaskTracker is a digital assistant that keeps your
schedule neat and organized. It displays all your events lined up for the day,
upcoming deadlines and also tasks that do not have a specific time/ date, on
the same window.

You can perform various operations such as add/ delete/ edit/ prioritize, on
your events by simply typing a one-line command,
as TaskTracker has a flexible command line interface suited to your needs and comfort.
You don’t need to waste any
more time navigating through multiple options or filling multiple fields every
time you want to modify your schedule.

TaskTracker makes time-management smart and simple for you!

## Quick Start

1. Ensure you have Java version `1.8.0_60` or later installed in your computer.

    > Note: Having any Java 8 version is not enough.
    > This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.

2. Download the latest `TaskTracker.jar` from the 'releases' tab.

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your task database.

4. Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

5. Set up: enter your name and verify the current date and time.

6. You're good to go! Try adding your first Task. Press Enter to enter a
   command. For adding a floating task, try:
	
	* `add "Learn Task Tracker"`.

    ![alt text](./images/userguide/1.png "command bar")

    Let's do another one: 
	
	* `add "bake potatoes" p-2`

    ![alt text](./images/userguide/2.png "")

    Notice how `bake potatoes` is below `Learn Task Tracker`. That's because
    `bake potatoes` is of number 2 priority, while `Learn Task Tracker` with an
    undefined priority takes the default highest priority number of 0.

7. Let's add deadline tasks with due date and time.

	* `add "bake cookies" 31/12 3pm`

        `bake cookies` by 31 December of this year, 3pm. Undeclared year in date
        field will be taken as the current year.

	* `add "bake cookies" tdy 3pm`

        `bake cookies` by today, 3pm.

    ![alt text](./images/userguide/3.png "")

8. Next up, events. An event is a task with a start date, start time, end date
   and end time. Example commands are:

	* `add "CS2103t programming camp" 30/8 1pm to 3/1/2017 6pm`

        Event `CS2103t programming camp` starts from 1pm of the 30th August 2016, and ends at 6pm of the 3rd January 2017.

	* `add "potato peeling" tdy 3pm to 7pm`

        Event `potato peeling` starts from today's 3pm and ends at today's 7pm.

        Event `cupcake festival` starts from today's 8pm and ends at tomorrow's 12 pm.

	* `add "Trick or treat" 31/10 8pm to 9pm`

        Event `Trick or treat` starts from 8pm of 31st October this year and ends on the same day's 9pm.

    ![alttext](./images/userguide/4.png "")

9. To delete a task, try:

    ```
    del-float 2
    ```

    Delete floating task `bake potatoes`.

    ```
    del-deadline 1
    ```

    ```
    del-event 4
    ```

    Delete Event `Trick or treat`.

    ![alttext](./images/userguide/5.png "")

10. To edit a deadline, try:

	* `edit-deadline 1 dd-29/12 dt-2pm`

        The following properties of task are modified: 'due date' and 'due time'. (`dd` refers to due date, `dt` refers to due time)

        ![alttext](./images/userguide/7.png "")

    * `edit-event 2 st-3pm`

        Start time of `potato peeling` modified.

        ![alttext](./images/userguide/8.png "")

12. To edit a floating task, try:

	* `edit-float 1 p-1`

        Floating Task `Learn Task Tracker` is given a priority of `1`.
