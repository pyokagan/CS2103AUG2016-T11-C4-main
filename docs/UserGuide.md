## About

Unable to keep track of all your deadlines and other commitments?  Finding it
difficult to remember tasks which do not have a specific date and time, but
nevertheless needs to be done? Find yourself wasting time searching for
time-management software online, and selecting multiple options each time you
want to modify a task?

Fret not, TaskTracker is here to your rescue!

To be simply defined, TaskTracker is a digital assistant that keeps your
schedule neat and organized. It displays all your events lined up for the day,
upcoming deadlines and also tasks that do not have a specific time/ date, on
the same window.

You can perform various operations such as add/ delete/ edit/ prioritize, on
your events by simply typing a one-line command. You don’t need to waste any
more time navigating through multiple options or filling multiple fields every
time you want to modify your schedule.

TaskTracker makes time-management smart and simple for you!

## Quick Start

1. Ensure you have Java version `1.8.0_60` or later installed in your computer.

  > Having any Java 8 version is not enough.
  > This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.

2. Download the latest `TaskTracker.jar` from the 'releases' tab.

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your task
   database.

4. Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few
   seconds.

5. Set up: enter your name and verify the current date and time.

6. You're good to go! Try adding your first Task. Press Enter to enter a
   command. For floating task, try `add "Learn Task Tracker"`.

   ![alt text](./images/userguide/1.png "command bar")

   Let's do another one, `add "bake potatoes" 2`

   ![alt text](./images/userguide/2.png "")

   Notice how bake potatoes is below Learn Task Tracker. That's because bake
   potatoes is of number 2 priority, while Learn Task Tracker with an undefined
   priority takes the default highest priority number of 0.

7. Let's add deadline tasks with due date and time.

	* `add "bake cookies" 31/12 3pm`

      bake cookies by 31 December of this year, 3pm. Undeclared year in date
      field will be taken as the current year.

	* `add "bake cookies" tdy 3pm`

      Bake cookies by today, 3pm.

   ![alt text](./images/userguide/3.png "")

8. Next up, events. An event is a task with a start date, start time, end date
   and end time. Example commands are:

	* `add "CS2103t summer camp" 30/8 1pm 3/1/2017 6pm`

      Event CS2103t summer camp starts on 30 Aug 2016, 1pm, and ends on 3
      January 2017,6pm.

	* `add "potato peeling" tdy 3pm to 7pm`

      Event cupcake festival starts today 8pm and ends tomorrow 12 pm at NUS.

	* `add "Trick or treat" 31/10 8pm to 9pm`

      Event Trick or treat starts 31 October this year 8pm and ends on the same
      day, 9pm.

    ![alttext](./images/userguide/4.png "")

9. All task in the database will be assigned a unique index. The unique index
   can be seen to the left of the task name.

        del-float 2

    Delete floating task bake potatoes.

        del-deadline 1

    Delete deadline task bake cookies.

        del-event 4
