# Using Gradle

[Gradle](https://gradle.org/) is a build automation tool. It can automate build-related tasks such as 
* Running tests
* Managing library dependencies
* Analyzing code for style compliance

The gradle configuration for this project is defined in the _build script_  [`build.gradle`](../build.gradle). 
> To learn more about gradle build scripts,
refer [Build Scripts Basics](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/tutorial_using_tasks.html).

## Running Gradle Commands

To run a Gradle command, open a command window on the project folder and enter the Gradle command.
Gradle commands look like this:
* On Windows :`gradlew <task1> <task2> ...` e.g. `gradlew clean allTests`
* On Mac/Linux: `./gradlew <task1> <task2>...`  e.g. `./gradlew clean allTests`

> If you do not specify any tasks, Gradlew will run the default tasks `clean` `headless` `allTests` `coverage`

## Cleaning the Project

* **`clean`** <br>
  Deletes the files created during the previous build tasks (e.g. files in the `build` folder).<br>
  e.g. `./gradlew clean`
  
  >**Tip `clean` to force Gradle to execute a task**: <br>
  When running a Gradle task, Gradle will try to figure out if the task needs running at all. 
  If Gradle determines that the output of the task will be same as the previous time, it will not run
  the task. For example, it will not build the JAR file again if the relevant source files have not changed
  since the last time the JAR file was built. If we want to force Gradle to run a task, we can combine
  that task with `clean`. Once the build files have been `clean`ed, Gradle has no way to determine if
  the output will be same as before, so it will be forced to execute the task.
  
## Creating the JAR file

* **`shadowJar`** <br>
  Creates the `addressbook.jar` file in the `build/jar` folder, _if the current file is outdated_.<br>
  e.g. `./gradlew shadowJar`

  > To force Gradle to create the JAR file even if the current one is up-to-date, you can '`clean`' first. <br>
    e.g. `./gradlew clean shadowJar` 

**Note: Why do we create a fat JAR?**
If we package only our own class files into the JAR file, it will not work properly unless the user has all the other
  JAR files (i.e. third party libraries) our classes depend on, which is rather inconvenient. 
  Therefore, we package all dependencies into a single JAR files, creating what is also known as a _fat_ JAR file. 
  To create a fat JAR fil, we use the Gradle plugin [shadow jar](https://github.com/johnrengelman/shadow).

## Running the Application

* **`run`** <br>
  Builds and runs the application.

* **`runShadow`** <br>
  Builds the shadow JAR, and then runs it.

## Running Tests

The following project properties control test execution:

* `headless` -- Run tests in headless mode (default: `false`)

* `guiTests` -- Run GUI tests (default: `true`)

Here are some examples:

* `./gradlew -Pheadless=true test` -- Runs all tests in headless mode.

* `./gradlew -PguiTests=false clean test` -- Clean the project and runs only
  non-GUI tests.

## Updating Dependencies

There is no need to run these Gradle tasks manually as they are called automatically by other 
relevant Gradle tasks.

* **`compileJava`**<br>
 Checks whether the project has the required dependencies to compile and run the main program, and download 
 any missing dependencies before compiling the classes.<br>
 See `build.gradle` -> `allprojects` -> `dependencies` -> `compile` for the list of dependencies required.

* **`compileTestJava`**<br>
  Checks whether the project has the required dependencies to perform testing, and download 
  any missing dependencies before compiling the test classes.<br>
  See `build.gradle` -> `allprojects` -> `dependencies` -> `testCompile` for the list of 
  dependencies required.
